Few macros I wrote over time.
<br><br>
### Steering Wheel orientation
Reorients steering wheel to either base coordinate system or to current view (X and Y will lay "flat on screen")
<br><br>
### Replace model on draft
Replaces first model link of the draft with one that has same name as the draft file. Original model link file extension will be preserved
